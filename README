ABOUT

m2legovoxels converts .M files containing a 3D model into a voxelized version
suitable for rendering the original 3D models with Lego bricks. The output of
the program can be used with LDraw compatible programs.


REQUIREMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS

m2legovoxels has no dependencies. The user needs GCC, Make and tools to
generate .M files (e.g., 3DS models can be converted with the 3ds2m utility).

The models in source .M files are assumed to be watertight.


INSTALLATION

Run
	
	make

to compile the software. The resulting executable, m2legovoxels can be placed
in a binary directory in your path, e.g. with

	sudo cp m2legovoxels /usr/local/bin


USAGE

Run m2legovoxels with

	./m2legovoxels model.m nrlayers

where nrlayers is the number of layers (bricks). The program outputs several
views of the model and its voxelized layers. Additionally, it renders a
"model.m.ldr" file in LDR (LDraw) format which can be read by various Lego CAD
programs.

As an example, m2lgovoxels comes with a model of Michelangelo's David in
"david.m" which can be voxelized into 50 lego layers with

	./m2legovoxels david.m 50

The output can be used in several ways. It is advised that the user of this
software is confident with C++ and can play with the software to tune the
voxelizer.


HOW IT WORKS

m2legovoxels is a simple ray tracer. An array of rays, parallel to the X axis
are sent through the model and checked for being inside or outside of the
model.
